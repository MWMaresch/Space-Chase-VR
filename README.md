# Space-Chase-VR

A futuristic racing survival type VR game.

The player will control a vehicle (a sort of hover car) in a futuristic city while being chased by an enemy or group of enemies. The goal is to reach a warp gate (which is always moving away from the player) as fast as possible. The player loses if they are caught by the enemy chasing them.

The driving mechanics will include vertical movement along with horizontal movement. Therefore, instead of a traditional flat road to stay on, there will be a slipstream they must stay inside of to avoid losing speed. The whole time, there will be many other vehicles passing by which the player has to avoid.
